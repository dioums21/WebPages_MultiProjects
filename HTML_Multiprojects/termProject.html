        <h3>Allen Iverson, Realtor</h3>
        My name is Allen Iverson and I am the one you are looking for. During past few years,
        the housing market has been out of control in the city of Toronto. My goal is to house as many families
        as possible, regardless of their credit score. <b><em>Everyone deserves a Home</em></b>,
        that is my philosophy. Whatever your budget, I will try my best to provide you a great monthly morgage
        price. Please look through my page for available listing properties. Should
        you find anything that appeals you, feel free to <a href="contactForm.html">contact me</a>.
